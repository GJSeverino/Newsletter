<h1 id="playing-video-games-on-algae">Playing Video Games on Algae</h1>
<p>Shared by <a href="mstdn.science/@lana">Lana</a></p>
<p>In this 2019 paper, researchers created a JavaScript web toolkit to allow real-time interaction with swarms of the algae Euglena, used as "active matter".
Beginner and expert users were then able to program little video games where the human gamer interacts with the algae through joysticks or leds.
Sadly <a href="https://github.com/hirklab/euglenalab">the code</a> seems to have gone stale since the paper was published, but have a look at the game descriptions and this video of the interface.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure from the paper showing screen captures of the different games created by users. Caption: Study participants (studies S1b and S1c) were enabled to create a variety of interactive biological applications (A‚ÄìD, Top is screenshot and A‚ÄìD, Bottom is illustrative picture of program). (A) (novice user, study S1b) A video game where the player must get specific Euglena into a moving virtual green box, controlled by the player, while the user-directed LEDs shine in the direction of the moving box, making the Euglena move away from the target goal. (B) (expert user, study S1c) A continuously rotating line visualizing the average orientation of all organisms detected by the BPU. (C) (expert user, study S1c) A two-player game where the first player shoots the red ball from a particular position with the aim of hitting as many Euglena as possible, while the second player then tries to steer the Euglena with the arrow keys (mapped to LEDs) so that the ball avoids as many Euglena as possible. (D) (semiexpert user) A histogram of Euglena rotations on the screen, grouped into bucket sizes of 10¬∞. This program allows the user to change the intensity of the four LEDs by dragging four sliders on the screen. This program was created by an undergraduate who did not participate in any study and who later joined the research team. Mouse click event listeners were not explicitly supported by the current version of Bioty but were added through native JavaScript mouse event handlers on the HTML5 canvas." src="https://alife-newsletter.github.io/Newsletter/images_edition_011/euglena-game.png?h=100" /></p>

<p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/jovialthunder">OLIVE üå∫üêç</a></p>
<p><strong>Crescent Loom</strong> is a game about weaving new forms of life. Players build up an intuitive sense of central pattern generators by knitting bones, stitching muscles, and linking neurons to design an underwater creature in a biologically-realistic neuronbiology simulation. After using these Lego-like biological tools to make a creature, it is then put to the challenge of exploring environments, navigating past hazards, and competing against each other in races ‚Äî all with constant access to view and modify their simulated nervous system in real time. </p>
<p><img alt="Animation of a creature swimming with its nervous system lighting up on the side" src="https://alife-newsletter.github.io/Newsletter/images_edition_011/crescent_01.gif?h=100" /></p>
<p>By wrapping a detailed RC-circuit model in a friendly user interface, it is designed to be the most accessible entryway into previously-gated high-level neuroscience concepts like reciprocal inhibition, postinhibitory rebound, reversal potentials, and channel-based intrinsic membrane properties. Over 5000 creatures have been made and uploaded to the public pool.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of the connectome explorer" src="https://alife-newsletter.github.io/Newsletter/images_edition_011/crescent_02.png?h=100" /></p>
<p>There is also a virtual wetlab "Connectome Explorer" which provides mock lab tools to puzzle out obscured connectomes of creatures created in the game's editor. Students can collect data to map unknown nervous systems using ablation, optogenetics, current clamping, and pharmacological blockers of excitation, inhibition, and action potentials.</p>

<h1 id="book-review-the-mountain">Book Review: "The Mountain"</h1>
<p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/Jallafsen">Kai Olav Ellefsen</a></p>
<p>"Mountain" is a short story from 2012 by Liu Cixin, author of The
Three-Body Problem. It is available in the Apex Magazine or in
the short story collection "The Wandering Earth".</p>
<p>Mountain tells the story of an alien ship appearing on Earth, and the
aliens describing how they developed into a space faring
civilization. From an ALIFE-perspective, this story is fascinating, as
it asks the question of how a civilization would develop if it started
out with conditions that are very different to those faced by life on
earth.</p>
<p>The aliens describe their species originating in a space they call the
"Bubble World": A spherical space without gravity around 3,500 miles
in diameter, surrounded by a solid wall of rock in all
directions. Similar to human explorers throughout the ages, the aliens
after a while developed a drive to discover what existed beyond the
walls of their bubble world and began developing technology for
tunneling through the rock wall. "Mountain" goes on to describe in
fascinating detail how this alien species went on to form theories
about the universe they found themselves in, allowing them to find
their way out of the "Bubble world" and eventually even begin to
explore other planets.</p>
<p>The details of the aliens' journey are best experienced in the short
story. From an ALIFE perspective, I found it fascinating to see this
very detailed description of how a civilization could develop
technology, form theories about their surroundings and explore their
universe in an environment so different from the one our civilization
has developed in. For instance, the story describes the iterative
development of scientific theory through generations of the aliens'
lifetimes: Initially, the aliens believed their world was one of
potentially several hollow bubbles in an otherwise solid
universe. They called this cosmology the Solid Universe
Theory. However, after thousands of years of exploring deep into the
walls of their bubble, the aliens make a surprising discovery: The
density of the walls decreased in all directions - indicating there
may be an outer edge beyond which their universe is no longer
solid. Obviously, this discovery shook the alien society, leading some
(the Solid Universe purists) to dismiss it with alternative
explanations, while others saw it as a beginning of a new scientific
theory of their universe.</p>
<p>Liu Cixin has done a very impressive job carefully thinking of the
details of how an alien society would work in these strange
environmental conditions, and by describing these details he forces
the reader to reflect on our own planet, and our own theories of
physics and cosmology.</p>

<p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/Imy_TK">Imy Khan</a> on behalf of the ERA Board.</p>
<p>The Emerging Researchers in Artificial Life (ERA) group is transitioning over to Discord as the main platform of communications. The community is growing (again), and we would love to have you there. Since it's inception, the intention for the ERA group has been to create a space for (self-identifying) emerging (early) researchers in the ALife community to make connections, have discussions, and generally find ways to connect and have fun. </p>
<p>The ERA group is also running informal seminars and hang outs every few weeks on Discord, where you can also learn a little bit more about the group and its current members.</p>
<p>Please join the Discord using the link <a href="https://discord.gg/fvJkKCKy4C">here</a>. See you inside.</p>
<h1 id="paper-review-on-modeling-life-by-chris-adami-1994">Paper Review - <strong>On Modeling Life</strong> by Chris Adami (1994)</h1>
<p>Paper Link: <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/artl/article-abstract/1/4/429/2236/On-Modeling-Life">Here</a>
Review By <a href="https://twitter.com/Imy_TK">Imy Khan</a>.</p>
<p>This month, I spent a little bit of time digging into the Artificial Life journal archives with two aims: first, to get a better understanding of the type of reesarch that the artificial life field consisted of in the early years after its inception, and secondly, to find a paper that captures (in my view) the <strong>essence</strong> of artificial life, as if to show to someone unaware of the field, <em>"Hey, look, this is the kind of thing Artificial Life is interested in exploring."</em></p>
<p><a href="https://direct.mit.edu/artl/article-abstract/1/4/429/2236/On-Modeling-Life?redirectedFrom=fulltext">On Modeling Life</a>, written by Chris Adami and published in 1994 in the Artificial Life journal, is one such paper. The title itself is a bold statement, sure to catch the eye of future readers (it caught mine). The paper puts forth a model of life consisting of three minimal characteristics - self-replication of information, bit-wise mutation of information, and an environment (landscape) of information - proposing that a system consisting of these can form the foundations of a (minimally-)living system, with good universal approximation. Adami puts forth theoretical and experimental results (using Tierra and Avida) in defense of this point. Though the entire paper is worthy of a read, I was particularly enticed by this notion that Darwininan evolution may not have been a continuous process, but may have been "punctuated": where there were periods of stasis followed by large evolutionary changes (this may have common knowledge to some, but was completely new information to me!). Assuming the minimal criteria for living systems used in the model, Adami presents further experimental results to support this notion. It is statatements and experimental results like these that truly capture the beauty of ALife, in my opinion.</p>
<p>As a general musing, I also appreciate the conciseness of the paper: at only 10 pages including all of the images and references, it's a paper you can do a first read of fairly swiftly to get a good grasp of the main ideas. Even <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/artl/article-abstract/1/4/353/2234/Evolving-3D-Morphology-and-Behavior-by-Competition">Karl Sims' paper in the same year</a> was (only) 20 pages, with roughly half of the space occupied with images. In my view, at least, there seems to be more of a trend towards longer papers in recent years, but reading this paper made me feel a sense of aneomoia for much shorter, much more concrete papers.</p>

<p>Scientific American published an article on Artificial Life, and interviewed many familiar names about where they think the field is going.
This piece was more than one year in the works, and is a good intro to our field if your relatives keep asking you "what do you work on again?" and you're struggling to provide a family-friendly answer!
I don't personally agree with 100% of the opinions in the article, but I think it's really well done and I enjoyed reading it!</p>
